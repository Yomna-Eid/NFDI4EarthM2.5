# Overview of data cube technologies and review of other emerging technologies

This document describes the state of the art solutions for local and cloud based data storage and analysis for large gridded data.



## Data formats and databases

In this section we discuss data formats and data bases that are often used for the handling of large gridded geospatial data. 

### Cloud Optimized Geotiffs
Cloud optimized geotiffs are geotiff files which are organized, so that they can be hosted on a HTTP file server. The aim is to allow more efficient workflows on the cloud. COGs in contrast to plain geotiffs can be opened only partially and so it is not needed to download the whole file but you can access only the parts of the file, that are actually needed. The cloud optimized geotiff files can be used like normal tiff files and therefore this format is supported by many libraries and software solutions. 


### HDF5

### NetCDF

NetCDF stands for Network Common Data Form and is one of the standard data formats in the geosciences. It is a binary format. The development for NetCDF started in 1988 by UCAR. A NetCDF file is self describing, which means, that it includes a header that describes the data that is included in the netcdf file. 
The most common used NetCDF version is NetCDF-4 which is based on the [HDF 5](#hdf5) format. 
It allows for efficient subsetting but it can not be accessed multi threaded.


### Tile DB


### Zarr

Zarr is a data format for handling of large N-dimensional typed arrays. It focuses on support for distributed storage systems (i.e. object stores). 
It aims to provide efficient I/O for parallel computing.
It can handle different chunks and there are mutliple extensions of the data format for different use cases. It can handle compression. 
It is for data sets that are larger than RAM. The computations on these datasets should be parallizable.
